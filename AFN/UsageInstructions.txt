<<< JAMES ALGORITHMS >>>
To build an AFN you can use any of the options included on the Main Menu, I'll explain every option below:

1. Crear AFN Basico

First you need to know that there are only 3 automaton available to build, with these 3 automatons you can build any type of Regular Expression
or Analyzer, etc.

When you create an AFN you need to specify the character with which the automaton will be build.

2. UNIR

When you join two AFNs you just select them and click the button "OK" ignoring the other 2 text box that appear in the middle.

You use those two text boxes when you join any automaton to the AFN T. The first one is the "token number" selected to that automaton and the 
second one is the "token string" e.g. "& 10 CONCAT".

6. CONVERTIR A AFD

When you convert a AFN to AFD two thing happen:
- The AFN is converted to AFD
- The AFD is sent to a default text file known as "AFD.txt" this is the default AFD text file the program will be reading when
  selecting the option 7 from the Main Menu.
